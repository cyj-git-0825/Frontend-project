                        The Guernsey Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (GSPCA) said it would be hosting a dog first aid course on 12 November along with a session aimed at cats a week later.</p>

                    <p class="card-p">Our feline furry friends love to roam the outdoors, but ideally they should stay inside overnight during cold weather.<br><br>
                        But if your pet is determined to explore despite the snow and cold, the PDSA advises you ensure they can get back inside through a cat flap, or have warm shelter they can go to.<br><br>
                        During the day, cats should be given the choice to go out if they're used to going outside.<br><br>
                        The charity also says it is a good idea to provide your cat with litter trays inside, even if they always like to toilet outside. This gives them the option of keeping warm indoors.</p>

                    <p class="card-p">Some new cat box fillers are marketed as more sustainable than conventional litters, including a few that claim to be flushable or compostable. (Spoiler: They're not.) <br><br>
                        Others are made from agricultural leftovers like walnut shells.<br><br>
                        We've dug deep to see which ones are good for your kitty and the environment. Here's what we learned.</p>
